___________________________________________________
RELEASE NOTES for FTM & Co 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 (02/2008)

This release should replace all former releases of FTM and is taking into account all issues concerning the (backward) compatibility with existing FTM 1.x & 2.x patches.
With this release the stability of FTM on multi-processor machines has been significantly improved (and will be further improved from here).
This version is also the basis of an FTM release for PureData currently under development.

The work on the new ftm.editor external is still in progress and will be finalised for one of the following releases.

Tracked improvements and bug fixes:

FTM
- the set of FTM classes (fmat, dict, sequence) has been stabilised and fully documented
- the set of functions has been extended and fully documented
- the features of the FTM message box (expressions) have been consolidated and fully documented (see ftm.mess.help)
- finalised variable declarations with ftm.object (using the var "keyword")
- finalised ftm.o and ftm.m externals as non-graphical versions of ftm.object and ftm.mess (especially for first Pd port)
- ftm.object now outputs the object after importing via a file open dialog (messages "import" and "importas" without filename argument)
- calls to "import" and "importas" methods without filename within expressions "($myobj import)" are deprecated
- the optional dictionary argument for the "eval" method of the "expr" class has been removed (see help patch)
- fixed several issues concerning the FTM 1.7 file compatibilty
- fixed issues concerning the replacement of abstraction arguments (#1, #2, #3 etc.) in ftm.mess and ftm.object
- fixed import of text files with '.'-leaded floats (e.g. ".007")
- fixed issue of weird characters appearing at the end of an expression in the FTM message box (ftm.mess)

Gabor
- added attribute @sr to gbr.yin and gbr.bands (to enable resampled inputs)
- added attribute @unit to gbr.copy, gbr.dline~/drain~/paste/ola~/slice~/fire~/tapin~/tapout~ (unit for duration and frequency parameters)
- gbr.resample now provides a mode for integer downsampling (by taking the mean)
- gbr.yin now outputs the autocorrelation (which was already calculated internally)
- fixed gbr.peaks (now working again)
- limited gbr.resampling factor (increment) from 1/8 to 8
- improved the performance of gbr.yin (pitch output is now more tolerant for noisy input signals)
- included new example patches
- fixed issue in gbr.dline, gbr.drain and gbr.ola~ causing clicks when the grain/frame size equals the delay line size
- fixed issue for gbr.copy/paste/tapin~/tapout~ referencing gbr.dline~/drain~ by a simple symbol (without $)
- fixed issue in gbr.addpartials for single int input for frequency and amplitude
- fixed issue of missing initialisation with default values for declared number arguments (e.g. for "gbr.slice~ #1 #2")

MnM
- added mnm.svmmap to the distribution
- help patches fixed
- fixed issue in mnm.delta when using cascaded deltas, the second filter being longer (the reoutput input was not delayed)
- improved help patches

API and SDK
 - a first version of an FTM external API is available that is compatible with this version
 - the doxygen documentation of the FTM core API has been improved (even if there is still a lot of work to do)

Please note that the error checking in the FTM message box is slightly more strict than before and might report some errors that have been omitted in former versions. If you encounter error messages in your patches where you didn't see any before, please consider first the possibility that this error always was existing (even though not reported) and should be fixed in your patch (the error messages also should be significantly clearer in this version).

Attention: FTM is still not entirely thread-safe. A completely thread-safe release of FTM is expected for spring 2008.
Messages or expressions that are executed in different threads (alarm, GUI/main, UDP input, etc) and simultaneously modify FTM data structures (objects) can cause crashes. The easiest way to avoid this is to reschedule congruent accesses to FTM object into the same thread. The externals "pipe" or "ftm.schedule" (that now is thread-safe) with a 0 delay time would always output in the alarm ("high priority") thread while "defer" and "deferlow" can be used to reschedule messages in the Max main application (GUI) thread.

FTM classes:
- normalised messages to FTS objects (fill, clear, zero, set, get)
- completed set-methods between classes fmat, fvec, mat, dict, bpf and sequence
- The expression "(info functions)" now prints a complete list of functions with a short description.
- ftm.editor object added (editor for ftm classes: at the moment just bpf and track of fmat); VERY EXPERIMENTAL!!!

FTM expression evaluator changes:
 - The functionalities in expressions for the following cases have been unified:
	- assignment of objects and expression-private variables, e.g. ($x = ...)
	- assignment of object elements, e.g. ($x[0] = ...)
	- increment of objects with '+=', '-=', '*=' and '/=' of objects and expression-private variables, e.g. ($x += ...) or ($x -= ...)
	- increment of object elements, e.g. ($x[0] += ...) or ($x[0] += ...)
	- binary operators, e.g. ($1 * 0.5 + 3 / 2)

  - In all cases apply the following rules:
	- the '+' and '+=' operators concatenate symbols
	- binary division '/' always has a float result
	- objects can be assigned (implemented using the "set" methods), e.g. ($myfmat = $yourfmat)
	- fmats can be incremented ('+=', '-=', '*=', '/=') (implemented using the methods "add", "sub", etc), e.g. ($myfmat += $yourfmat)
	- fmats can be used in binary operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') (implemented using the methods for "add", "sub", "bus", etc), e.g.  
	  ($myfmat + $yourfmat * $hisfmat)

Gabor:
- Added MFCC to gabor:
- gbr.bands modified: there is now several mel bands modes
- gbr.dct added: discrete cosine transform
- gbr.lifter added

RELEASE NOTES for FTM 1.7.5 (May 5, 2006)

- scoob track chordseq import/export in SDIF
- MnM. New mnm.nmd object (OSX version only):

Non-Negative Matrix Decomposition (NMD) using Sparseness Constraints:

This object is destined for realtime decomposition of an incoming vector (fmat, first inlet) using known template structures (matrix fmat, second inlet) with a normalisation factor that can be controlled in realtime (number, 3rd inlet). It can be used for mapping of an incoming signal to "known" templates that are shown once to the object in the second inlet as a matrix. Note that both the input vector and templates should contain non-negative values. Other controllable parameters include:

@sH : between 0 and 1, the sparsity measure
@criteria : the error criteria (default is 0.01)
@maxiter : Maximum number of iteration used at each instance (default is 100)

As application examples, the object can be used to recognise instrumental templates or multiple-pitches of known pitches of an instrument in realtime. One application is described in:

Arshia Cont, "Realtime Audio to Score Alignment for Polyphonic Music Instruments Using Sparse Non-negative constraints and Hierarchical HMMs", in IEEE International Conference in Acoustics and Speech Signal Processing (ICASSP), May 2006.

RELEASE NOTES for FTM 0.9 (BETA, June 15, 2004)

Changes mainly introduce several new methods for fmat and track classes and
minor bug fixes.

The track now can display bars and tempo changes (import from standard MIDI
files for scoob tracks).

FTM externals from now on check for a specific FTM version.
9.1 : bug fixes in fmat methods (exp, log)
9.2 : bug fix in gui communication (was crashing on certain GUI actions such as deleting scoobs from a track)

___________________________________________________
RELEASE NOTES for FTM 0.8 (BETA, April 15, 2004)

- FTM supports now global and local scopes for names.
- For ftm.object the scope of a named FTM object is set via the inspector (see help patch ftm.object.help).
- With ftm.define a new object was included to the set of FTM externals. This object allows the definition of constants (simple values and tuples associated to an FTM name in local or global scope - see help patch ftm.define.help) and mainly was introduced as a straight forward way to define FTM names from the arguments of an abstraction (#1, #2, #3, etc).
- Numerous minor fixes and extensions are not mentioned in these release notes.

___________________________________________________
RELEASE NOTES for FTM 0.7 (BETA, March 16, 2004)

Yes, it's already number 7 but actually the second one released to the public.
While the first public release (6) was labeled "version I" this one is
correctly marked as BETA.  The following releases will stay BETA until we think
one really serves to be I.

The only but important change of this release is that the FTS message box
(ftm.mess) references the arguments (elements of the incoming list) starting
from 1 ($1, $2, $3, etc.) just like the traditional Max message box and not
from 0 as is was still in release 6.
